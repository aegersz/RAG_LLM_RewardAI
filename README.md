# Generative Reward-Based AI (RAG + LLM) Pseudologic

## Purpose

This repository contains a pseudologic framework outlining the interaction between **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** in a **Generative Reward-Based AI** system.

The goal is to enhance AI-generated responses by integrating external knowledge retrieval and reinforcement-based optimization.

## Context
AI models often suffer from hallucinations or lack of up-to-date information. **RAG** improves factual accuracy by retrieving relevant context before generation. A **reward mechanism** fine-tunes responses based on feedback, ensuring continuous self-improvement.

This pseudologic serves as a conceptual foundation for developers designing AI systems that integrate retrieval-based augmentation with generative models.

## Features
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Enhances LLM outputs with external data.
- **Generative AI (LLM)**: Produces context-aware responses.
- **Reward Mechanism**: Improves system behavior over time using feedback-based reinforcement.
- **Optimization**: Ranks and refines responses for better accuracy and reliability.

## File Structure
- `RAG_LLM_Pseudocode.txt` → The pseudologic outline.
- `README.md` → This document, explaining purpose and context.

## Future Plans
- Expand into an actual implementation using Python and TensorFlow/PyTorch.
- Integrate a real reward-based training mechanism.
